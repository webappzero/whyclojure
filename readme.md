# Welcome to Clojure!

This presentation summarizes why I use Clojure as my language of choice.

## Instructions

If you are new to git or GitHub, the easiest way to download the files needed to 
view this presentation is to visit this link:

https://github.com/webappzero/whyclojure/archive/master.zip

Unzip the downloaded file ```master.zip```, and double-click the file ```index.html```
located in the ```html-version``` directory.

Alternatively, if you are on MacOS you can view the Keynote presentation instead
of the HTML version, by simply double-clicking on the ```why-clojure.key``` file
located in the root directory of ```master.zip```.
